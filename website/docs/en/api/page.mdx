# Page

In pareto, pages are defined as the `ParetoPage` type, which provides some utility functions.

## getServerSideProps

getServerSideProps is a function that is called at request time on the server side. It can be used to fetch data from an external API, query a database, or perform other server-side tasks.

## setUpClient

setUpClient is a function that is called on the client side. It can be used to set up the client side of the page, such as initializing a library or setting up event listeners.

## getAssets

In our streaming rendering, we will send down static JS and CSS resources the moment the request reaches the server. This function allows you to customize and add some page-specific static elements. For example, it could be the large image URL of a product detail page.
For example

```tsx
const Home: ParetoPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

Home.getAssets = () => {
  return [
    {
      type: 'image',
      url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
    },
  ]
}
```
