# Shared API

Shared API is exposed in `@paretojs/core`.

## useStyles

useStyles is used to collect critical CSS, for example:

```tsx
import styles from './style.iso.scss'

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## promiseMap

promiseMap is used to manage the promise status of requests, and it is isomorphic between the server and the client.

## mockClientPromise

mockClientPromise is used to initialize the promise status on the client side.

## use

use is a polyfill. In a `React 19` environment, it will directly use the use exported by `React 19`. In `React 18`, it will fallback to the polyfill defined in pareto. Note that the polyfill use can only be used to resolve promises.
