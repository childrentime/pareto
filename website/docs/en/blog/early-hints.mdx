# EarlyHints

First, please read about what [`early hints`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/early-hints) are.

## Does nextjs support it?

Unfortunately, it does not support this feature. You can refer to this [discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/36089) to see more.

In fact, I tried to achieve this in the page router of Next.js, but unfortunately, once you use `res.flushHeaders()` on a custom server, Next.js rendering functions will not work.

The only possible solution might be to use the `app router`, and you need to wrap the `children` property of `layout` with suspense. In this way, Next.js will return the static HTML outer box at the beginning of the request.

```tsx
// layout.tsx
export default function Layout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return <Suspense>{children}</Suspense>
}
```

## Does pareto support it?

Yes, Pareto has this feature built-in. Regardless of whether you have enabled streaming rendering, Pareto will send out your page's static resources right at the beginning of the request.
