# Conventional Route

## What is it

Pareto uses file system routing, and the file path of the page is simply mapped to the routing path, which makes the routing of the entire project very intuitive.

```bash
app
├── home
│   └── index.tsx #routed to /home
└── user
    └── index.tsx #routed to /user
```

## Custom Behavior

If you don't want to use the 'app' folder as your routing folder, you can also customize the name through configuration.

```ts
import { ParetoConfig } from '@pareto/core/config'

const config: ParetoConfig = {
  pageDir: 'pages',
}

export default config
```
