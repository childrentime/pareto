# Staic Asset

Each route corresponds to a page that has its own static resources, such as CSS, JS, etc.

Pareto will dispatch these static resources in the head tag element the instant a request reaches your server. This allows the browser to download and parse these resources during the gap in server interface requests.

Pareto provides a `getAsset` method, which is useful for adding some page-related static resources. This is very useful in some preview pages.

For exmaple:

```tsx
const Home: ParetoPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

Home.getAssets = () => {
  return [
    {
      type: 'image',
      url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
    },
  ]
}
```

The data returned from getAssets will be converted into link tags and inserted into the page. The difference between this and the metadata from `react-async-helmet` is that its dispatch timing will be earlier.
