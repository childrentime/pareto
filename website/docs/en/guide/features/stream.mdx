# Stream

Pareto provides first-class support for stream rendering.

## Usage

:::note
We assume that you already have experience using stream rendering. If not, you can refer to these articles to understand what stream rendering is.

### Define stream request and key

Based on experience, we only need to stream the requests of modules with slow interfaces. First, let's define the request method and key value.

```ts
// data.ts
export const getRecommendsKey = 'getRecommends'
export const getRecommends = () => fetch('/api/recommends')
```

### Setup server side promise

Pareto exports a promiseMap object to maintain the promise status of each request corresponding to the key value. Let's set it up.

```tsx
Home.getServerSideProps = async () => {
  // we don't need wait for stream request
  promiseMap.set(getRecommendsKey, getRecommends())
  // request that need wait
  const repositories = await fetch('/api/repositories')
  return repositories
}
```

### Setup client side promise

A well-known joke is: React needs to maintain consistency between the first render on the server and the client, and we also need to synchronize the promise status between the server and the client.

```tsx
Home.setUpClient = async () => {
  // mock client promise, it only will be resolved when server stream data is ready
  mockClientPromise(getRecommendsKey)
}
```

### Consume Promise

Oh heavens! We've finally arrived here. By using use and suspence in React to consume our request promises, we can achieve stream transmission.

:::note
The `use` hook was only introduced in React 19, so for React 18, you need to use the `use` function exported from `Pareto`. Note that it only implements the ability to consume promises.

```tsx
// React19
import { use } from 'react'
// React18
import { use } from '@paretojs/core'

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>hello world</div>
      <Suspense fallback={<RecommendsSkeleton />}>
        <Recommends />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}

const Recommends = () => {
  const { feeds } = use(promiseMap.get(getRecommendsKey)!)

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <div className={styles.title}>Recommends</div>
      {feeds.map((item, index) => (
        <div className={styles.item} key={index}>
          ...
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
