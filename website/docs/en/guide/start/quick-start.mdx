# Quick Start

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme'

## 1. Initialize the project

You can create a Rspress project using the `create-pareto` cli:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create pareto@latest" />

Input the project directory name, and then the cli will create the project for you.

## 2. Start Dev Server

Start the local development service with the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

:::tip TIP

For the dev command, you can specify the port number or host of the development service with the `--port` or `--host` parameter, such as `pareto dev --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0`.
