# SPA

Pareto provides good support for client-side rendering

## Usage

Sometimes, when your website traffic is too high, not using server-side rendering can greatly 
increase your server's traffic capacity. In Pareto, you can enable this feature by setting `enableSpa: true` 
in the `pareto.config.ts`. When this configuration is enabled, if your URL link contains a `__csr` parameter and it is 
truthy, Pareto will only return an empty HTML skeleton from the server, with the remaining content loaded by 
the client-side JavaScript.

```ts
// pareto.config.ts
import { ParetoConfig } from "@paretojs/core/config";

const config: ParetoConfig = {
  enableSpa: true
};

export default config;
```

:::note
It's important to note that when you start using the SPA capability, you need to determine whether you are currently

in SPA mode and request the corresponding data on the client side. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/childrentime/pareto/tree/main/examples/spa) to accomplish this.
